# Bliss

Bliss is a Gem oriented social media app that focuses on connecting users in a colorful and shiny way.<br />
The App is centered around **Gems** - Texts/Images/Polls - that **Miners** can post on the App to tell a **story**, an **incident** or any **random thought**.<br />

# Design

The Design folder contains the Figma design and the Database model<br />
Below is the Figma behind the app (Keep in mind that this might not exactly be the same as the actual App)<br /><br />
